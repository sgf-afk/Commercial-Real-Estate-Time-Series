# Commercial-Real-Estate-Time-Series
Analysis of local commercial market using county level data, time series, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. 

The idea is to create a generalized commercial market index to be used in order to assist in making decisions on purchasing 
or selling commercial real estate in Gainesville, FL.

Following up on the index I've created some visualizations using plotly maps, run some test predictions using supervised learning, and 
used unsupervised learning to detect additional trends in the market.
